#OpenBeerDB API

The API for the OpenBeerDatabase Project.

## About The Project

The goal of the Open Beer Database is to centralize basic beer and brewery information. We respect and enjoy all of the beer related communities that have sprung up across the internet, however, our main concern is the non-open nature of these community's databases. The continual duplication of this data will eventually lead to incomplete and/or out-of-date sources for basic beer and brewery data.

Furthermore, as a developer, if you want to create a simple, useful beer application, you have to essentially create your own database. The new database would be made from scratch, and most likely involve scraping the data from current online communities. With a regularly updated database file and an easy-to-use Application Programming Interface (API), the Open Beer Database will allow anyone to create web based or mobile applications, without the need for duplicating beer and brewery data that already exists.

Our hope is that by centralizing the data, and making it entirely open, this project will not only improve beer and brewery data accuracy, but also aid in the development of many helpful beer related applications.

## Now What?

The API is currently being written on the LightVC framework.  

Assuming you've already cloned the repository, you should be able to start at step #4 of their [Quickguide](http://www.lightvc.org/docs/quickstart_guide/).

## TODO

* More API functionality
* More extensive setup instruction
* Better documentation
